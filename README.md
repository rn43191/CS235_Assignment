Artificial Intelligence Assignments

***Assignment 1:*** Problem Solving 8-Queens problem using Uniform Cost Search
- Initial State:
No queens are on the board
- States:
A state is any arrangement of 0 to 8 queens on the board. We can even have a state where any arrangement of 0-8 queens is done with no queen under attack.
- Actions:
The operators add queens to any empty square or add queen to leftmost empty square such that it is not attacked by other queens.
- Path cost:
1 per every move
- Goal state:
Arranging 8 queens on the board such that no one is under attack by any other queen.
>Uniform Cost search is basically Breadth first search if the path cost is same for every move.

***Assignment 2:***
Problem Solving Travelling Salesman using A* Heuristic Search

*Assumption : Each city is connected to every other city i.e., complete graph.*
- Initial State: 
Agent in the start city and has not visited any other city
- Edge-cost: 
distance between the cities represented by the nodes, use this cost to calculate g(n).
- h(n): 
distance to the nearest unvisited city from the current city + estimated distance to travel all the unvisited cities (MST heuristic used here) + nearest distance from an unvisited city to the start city. 
- Goal State:
Agent has visited all the cities and reached the start city again

***Assignment 4:***
The game of sticks: To design a Min/Max game tree with alpha-beta pruning for the game.

The description of the game is as follows:
- It is a 2-player game.
- There is a heap of sticks on a board, say N.
- Each player picks up sticks alternatively.
- On their turn, each player has to pick at least 1 stick and he can pick at most 3 sticks.
- The one who has to pick the final stick will be the loser.â€¢First turn will be randomly decided with toss.
- To design AIvsHUMAN and AIvsAI game.

***Human Vs Human is also implemented***
